                        topic, even one avenue in the art world, just let’s see
                        what happens, enjoying the journey of what comes out of
                        it, see what can be mixed and used to bring the ideas to
                        life. He is a narrative in his own right, an ever

                        for films, designing many elements within the film
                        production, also designing interiors, costumes,
                        furniture, etc. His personal work is poetry, drawing and
                        sculptural work, as well as redesigning and recycling

                        than what anyone ever imagined. Never ask jerry to go
                        crazy on the imagination, a request often asked and a
                        request often regretted by clients for the trip took

                        “As a baby of less than a year he often disappeared with
                        his mother asking where is Jerry, I usually find him in
                        his room playing, when I opened the door, there was
                        Jerry on the floor adding a piece to a perfectly
                        balanced sculpture he has just built, much taller than
                        he was, he turned and smiled at me, then knocked it all
                        down with a giggle and started all over again. This was
                        normal in the Jerry’s world.”

                        His father often answers the question of why did Jerry
                        become an artist, a word Jerry doesn’t like to call
                        himself, creative is the word he uses, “Jerry never
                        became a creative, he was born that way.” With one
                        parent a painter and artist and the other a craftswoman,
                        adding to him failing every subject in school except the
                        Art of which he scored very high and winning every art
                        contest he entered as a child, no wonder his father
                        makes that statement.

                        Many of his childhood friends have said that: “Jerry was
                        never really in this world, always dreaming and
                        imagining other places we can never understand. But it
                        was a lot of fun him trying to bring us into those
                        worlds”
                    </p>
                    <p>Failed every subject in school except Art, his grades
                        dropped well short of university entrance, yet he has a
                        BA degree from one of the top universities in Perth
                        Western Australia. Senior heads often journied to high
                        schools for new recruits and when they stumbled across
                        Jerry, they were blown away with his exhibition. Most
                        students have assignment drawings and paintings, but
                        Jerry had a space four time larger, full of originally
                        imagined paintings, drawings, sculptures, miniatures and
                        poetry. “you will be in regardless of your grades”
                        remarked the head of the Art department. </p>
                    <p>“Jerry would have made it with or without the university,
                        as he was already that good and creative and in his own
                        world.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Poetry was a desperate natural need to find the answers
                        to a confusing world that ousted him. Joining Christian
                        groups in his early teens he soon discovered the answers
                        was not available and was strongly suggested to leave.
                        Knocking on doors one, two and three within the
                        confinements of social conditioning the journey drove
                        him to only one conclusive option, “all we seek with
                        truth in hand is all we are in ourselves and natures
                        understand.” Searching in poetry opened the doors
                        society slammed, an angry shy introvert locked the poems
                        in the rubbish bin after his discovery and frustrations
                        were spilled out onto the page. never seeing the light
                        of day, believing no one would care for them. A high
                        school stage performance with his close friend,
                        rewriting famous songs with their own lyrics, the school
                        exhibition and a Punk band he was in in university was
                        the only public taste of his earlier poetic works. In
                        his early thirties, his closest friend and first true
                        love and muse, Marianne accidently discovered his poem
                        amongst some drawings he gave her. Asking if it was his,
                        and with a ‘OH SHIT’ shy yes adding of their travels to
                        the rubbish bin urged the shocked, begging request to
                        thrown them to her. This amazing acceptance, sharing his
                        emotions, with deep discussions about them created an
                        outburst of often 5 poems a day drifting on her desk.
                        years of boxes and boxes of original poetry stacked up
                        in her mother’s house, sadly a fire destroyed the whole
                        house. This collaboration of sharing and finding the
                        answers still continue to this day.
                    </p>
                    <p>The practice of writing to his confidant continued well
                        after he left London to work in a studio in the US. She
                        stayed in London receiving many poems via email and
                        post. A habit that was established through these
                        correspondences, the inspiration for the poem from a
                        discussion with his friends, would receive the original
                        as a thank you, and with much surprise the gift was very
                        well appreciated, one case which affected and encouraged
                        Jerry deeply was his friend asked if the poem could be
                        passed to a friend in need, ‘troubled soul’ was its
                        name. Two weeks after his friend stated that she was
                        about to commit suicide but after reading the poem she
                        changed her mind.</p>
                    <p>This revelation conquered his fear and doubt and
                        continued to share his poetry with much surprising
                        appreciation and feedback. A close friend volunteered
                        for an organisation called ‘children of the night’ and a
                        willing Jerry wanted to help, he wrote three poems for
                        them, one called ‘Children of the night’. After reading
                        the poem, the children replied with one unanimous
                        question, ‘Is he one of us?’
                    </p>
                    <p>Completely shattered to tears with this response to his
                        pure and honest way of writing, Jerry continued with
                        more passion and trust. The original purpose of
                        answering his own questions did not change, but his
                        answers helping others did. Working on designing
                        costumes for a surreal musical his friend was writing, a
                        story of Noah’s Arc with the underlining theme of the
                        Holocaust, a theme strongly related to Jerry. A
                        university photographic assignment opened doors into the
                        secret life of a Jewish family, once presented with an
                        elegantly presented personally made book the father
                        brought Jerry to tears with, “Thank your family for
                        saving our race”, being a dutchman opened so many doors
                        of respect with historical kindness echoing throughout
                        the generations. ‘Noah’s Arc’ was no different and his
                        emotions with nature, Jerry added new layers to the
                        costume designs of the musical, A poem also came from
                        his tearful research upon the discovery of a photo in
                        Life magazine. A reading to the production comity with
                        the investors being survivors, crying and requesting the
                        poem for the Holocaust museum in LA. The poem is called
                        ‘Ragged dolled starving human beings’
                    </p>
                    <p>A growth and journey of surprising unexpected twists
                        developed into the body of poetry works he has today.
                        Even though hundreds were lost with the fire at his
                        friend’s mothers house in England, flooding at his other
                        friend’s house in Spain, termite attach at his father’s
                        house in Australia and being thrown away by Jerry and
                        some others who didn’t appreciate his work, the
                        collection is still large, strong and continuing.
                        Sculptural and design works have been created most his
                        life as mentioned earlier, from childhood to now he has
                        been creating original imagination trips for fun, most
                        have been destroyed by time or given away to friends
                        with few photos still existing, but passion has never
                        died with much encouragement from his parents.

                    <p>Born at home above a toy shop and convenience store owned
                        by his father in the Nederland’s, premature, nearly
                        dying just after birth, and the toy shop section
                        situated under where he was born, developing in a
                        creative environment of craft works in clothing,
                        puppets, jewellery, paintings etc, it’s only natural
                        Jerry lost his reality. 6 years of age and arriving in
                        Australia, not speaking the language, not fitting in
                        with other kids, being bullied throughout schooling
                        years, he naturally escaped into his imagination,
                        creative handicraft works, designing and building his
                        own bedroom at the age of 12, deigning and building the
                        home letterbox at the age of 8, participating in the
                        family touring puppet show throughout Perth, etc. </p>
                    <p>Star wars phenomime just hit the world and both he and
                        his brother did build models kits from star wars and
                        other sci-fi movies which was displayed at a sci-fi
                        marathon screenings in a theatre, but both continued
                        with designing and building their own models and the
                        reality of those ships, adding them to a huge mural
                        drawing they both drew of all the spaceships designed,
                        all to scale. This scale drawing beginnings continued
                        with his brother drawing and compiling in a book of
                        every car Citroen ever designed and made, all extremely
                        accurate and all to scale, one of many of jerry’s
                        projects follows similar ideas, just jerry being jerry
                        made it an extremely huge project of time, an extremely
                        detailed timeline on a net platform that allows every
                        visual detail to be seen and researched from anywhere in
                        the world at any time in history, a real form of time
                        traveling. The project is too big for jerry to do alone.
                        But history and sculptural works have always played a
                        part in Jerry’s creative outlet, from baby to well in
                        his teens Lego expressed his creative outlet, inventing
                        original pieces for the explorative enjoyment. Every
                        Christmas a new Christmas Lego model would rest next to
                        the tree.

                    <p>Rubbish and found objects, nature pieces and second hand
                        toys etc travelling his imagination into many
                        fantastical elaborate innovations that most people could
                        not keep up. Early twenties developed more opportunity
                        when destroying old houses became a part time job, a
                        great supply of unique rubbish pieces with a makeover
                        drew interest from friends who wished to own them. This
                        practice still continues in Jerrys creative space. Now
                        joined with his creative partner LiZi, a performance

                        The house is adorned with second hand items that was
                        either donated or found in the rubbish adding to the
                        depth of their sense of creativity and awareness of the
                        beauty in other people’s perception of rubbish, plastics
                        and non-natural materials is not welcome.

                    <p>Drawings and Illustration was nightmares in his reality,
                        the visions were magical, yet struggled at every line
                        placed on the page. Always sketched since very early in
                        his years, but never focused on practical foundations,
                        his father loved his drawings, was always amazed at his
                        skill, but was very critical of jerry’s habit on lined
                        paper, saying with frustrated tones, “your drawings are
                        great but not on lined paper”, a running joke in the
                        relationship of father and son in later years. Father
                        being a painter and illustrator jerry got pushed into
                        many areas of drawing art, painting lessons in nature,
                        being taught how to see and techniques on how to paint
                        and draw, experimenting with many forms of drawing and
                        painting styles and methods, these were tough and fun
                        times for jerry as he just wanted to play with the
                        creativity of paint.

                    <p>“Drawing was always very hard for me, struggling with
                        every stroke of the pencil or pen. ironic that most of
                        my career have been drawing in the animation and film
                        industry, I always laugh at how I survived for so long.”

                    <p>In the studios he worked from his mid to late twenties he
                        was known as ‘the one who couldn’t draw but could do
                        amazing life drawings and animation drawings’. An
                        amazing observer of details was he, but construction was
                        very hard. With endless persistence mixed with sleepless
                        nights practicing he conquered his fear of drawing and
                        now does amazing illustrations of both imagination and
                        feeling. Observations of his journey in creativity, the
                        torture and glory are engraved within every page,
                        clearly visible in letter and line. With not fitting
                        into society well, being bullied in all his schooling
                        years, extremely shy to a point that in university he
                        would make and handout a detailed, fully illustrated and
                        photographed book instead of standing in front talking
                        about his research, his metaphorically and
                        compositionally playing creative illustrations and
                        poetry expresses the meaning of all he thinks and feels
                        clearly. These illustrations and poetry all delve into
                        multi-layered messages and meanings in every image and

                        metaphoric icons that have their own cultural meaning,
                        this is the fun part of expressing my honest thoughts
                        and feelings. What’s the point in making a work if

                        age that society has forced? Why should one stop being a
                        child in spirit and soul because society says the
                        numbers are too high?
                        Sorry society, I can’t live that way.”
                    </p>
                    <p>After so many years walking the path of this road on his
                        own, with the occasional partner periodically joining
                        his steps along the way, he has finally found his true
                        soul partner and creative twin. A union that has been
                        together for many lives, and again in this one. With
                        this union of souls, the journey becomes complete for
                        jerry, and the road he has been searching for is now a
                        road he can dance on. The power of this creative union
                        has woken the dragon and sparked new life in his
                        creative universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>Together they have many creative plans and lifestyle
                        directions that will open the future in an explosion of
                        wonders in nature, spirits and imagination. With full
                        trust and inspiration to the each other as well as
                        perfectionistic opinions towards each other’s works the
                        growth of jerry and LiZi, his creative partner is going
                        to explode in the art world. Both are very talented and
                        skilled in their individualism as well and perfectly
                        complimentary with the ideas, concepts and creations of
                        creative explorations and lifestyle ideals. After so
                        many years of being creative for others, jerry is
                        redirecting his focus on two main areas, his own
                        creative outlets and the growth of the partnership of
                        these two soul creatives, all leading in one direction
                        of self-expression and sharing experiences with others,
                        something jerry has been trying to do for years. The
                        legacy stands clear with the amount of creative variety
                        jerry has already achieved, as well as the achievements
                        of his partner, so the future looks amazing and expected
                        to be one full of magic, wonder and deeply felt
                        surprises as these two amazing souls share the life and
                        power of creativity and nature. For jerry this journey
                        is going back to his roots and back on the road he
                        promised to mother nature when he was a child, over the
                        years straying from his path by trying to fit into the
                        social world of human existence, and listening to the
                        advices of socially accepted mindsets, now with
                        childhood vigour and birth dragons passion this union he
                        has feels deeply to be the right path to take.
                        There are many projects and adventures the two have
                        designed and developed that will open a lot of eyes to
                        the reality of what real living and art is all about.
                        Let’s support them and encourage the purity of souls to
                        shout the magical, spiritual, natural way of seeing, the
                        way of being real.</p>
                    <p>PAINT YOUR COLORS
                    </p>
                    <p>I see the colors of the painting.
                        I fear the strokes of my uncertainty.
                        I am the blacks of my decisions,
                        and yellow and pink control the movements of my arm.
                    </p>
                    <p>I did combine the truth of my soul with the dreams of my
                        fantasy.
                        I did grow the thorns of my fear.
                        I did mix the right colors..., one day.
                        But soon all those colored dreams faded deep into the
                        night,
                        with the blinding light of the rising sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>I travel with the destiny of my actions,
                        and I work for the rainbows of my youth.
                        I anger at the path I’ve carved in this stone,
                        and yet I am guided by the words around my head.
                    </p>
                    <p>I discovered the realism when abstractions from the
                        truth, faded under the sun,
                        where impatience destroyed any attempt to play with my
                        fantasy and desire.
                        For happiness is chosen in the colors you bring,
                        and your birth and your grave carry equal tones,
                        one being white and the next full of all the mixers you
                        have created.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet a change of heart can rework the areas of distaste;
                        and repainting it is as easy as mixing a new pallet.
                        Sometimes hard especially when the pallet is already
                        muddy.
                        But recognizing those distasteful colors is as hard as
                        predicting the white canvas.
                        Uncertainty and propaganda muddle your decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>I see the colors I have painted,
                        I live in the destiny of my pallet,
                        and I paint each stroke with the traditions and regret
                        that society expects.
                        But the painting is one of me, and to repaint is always
                        my eyes.
                        I live my art, and I am my painting.
